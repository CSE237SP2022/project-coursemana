What user stories were completed this iteration?
What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line 
(or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)

User stories: 

A teacher object should have name, teacher ID, department, and title.
These fields are mutable.

A student object should have name, student ID, and year.
These fields are mutable.

A course object has name, teacher, capacity, and a list of students enrolled.
Its name, teacher, and capacity are mutable, and one can add or delete students
from a course object. 

User stories for the next iteration:

We would like to implement three new classes. A CommandParser class will parse 
and format the user commands from the command line. A Operation class will
define operations on the course objects. A CourseDatabase class will maintain
a list of all classes currently known to the program.

Everything that has been implemented during this iteration is currently working.

Currently we do not have a script that enables our program to be run on the command
line. However, all tests can be run from Eclipse by running the Java files under the 
'test' package.
